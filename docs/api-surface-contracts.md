# API Surface Contracts

This document describes the cross-cutting contracts the backend API guarantees
to clients, and how they are enforced in tests. It complements the generated
OpenAPI document served at `/api/openapi.json`.

## Unknown-route (404) contract

Any request that does not match a mounted route — wrong path, wrong method, or
a deleted endpoint — returns the same stable, machine-readable 404 body. The
response never echoes the request line, query string, request body, stack
traces, or internal routing details.

```json
{
  "error": "not_found",
  "code": "NOT_FOUND",
  "message": "The requested resource does not exist.",
  "requestId": "b6f1a2d4-8c3e-4a1b-9f2e-6d5c7a8b9c0d",
  "details": {}
}
```

Clients must branch on `code` (`NOT_FOUND`), never on `message`. The
implementation lives in `backend/src/middleware/error.ts` (`notFoundHandler`)
and is pinned by `backend/src/middleware/__tests__/unknown-route-contract.test.ts`.

## Deprecation and Sunset headers

Endpoints scheduled for removal advertise it on every response so clients can
migrate before the sunset date:

| Header        | Standard    | Meaning                                                            |
| :------------ | :---------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Deprecation` | RFC 9745    | IMF-fixdate the endpoint became deprecated.                        |
| `Sunset`      | RFC 8594    | IMF-fixdate after which the endpoint may stop responding.          |
| `Link`        | RFC 8288    | `<replacement>; rel="deprecation"` — where to migrate.             |

Example response headers:

```
Deprecation: Thu, 01 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT
Sunset: Fri, 01 Jan 2027 00:00:00 GMT
Link: </health/ready>; rel="deprecation"
```

Deprecations are declared in `API_DEPRECATIONS` in
`backend/src/middleware/deprecation.ts`. The registry is validated at boot: an
invalid date, or a `sunset` that is not after `deprecatedAt`, fails startup
rather than emitting a misleading header.

### Registering a new deprecation

1. Add an entry to `API_DEPRECATIONS` with `key`, `deprecatedAt`, `sunset`,
   `replacement` and a short `documentation` note.
2. Apply `deprecationHeaders("<key>")` to the route, e.g.

   ```ts
   router.get("/legacy-thing", deprecationHeaders("legacy-thing"), handler);
   ```

3. Add a case to `backend/src/middleware/__tests__/deprecation.test.ts`.
3. Note the removal window in the changelog/release notes.

`GET /health` (the backwards-compatibility alias for `GET /health/ready`) is
the first registered deprecation.

## Per-route rate limits

Route groups have deliberately distinct budgets (auth, admin, read, write,
SSE). The policies, env overrides, response headers and `429` payload are
documented in [rate-limiting-guidance.md](./rate-limiting-guidance.md).

## Contract tests

`backend/src/__tests__/api-contract.test.ts` runs the real Express app and
checks the responses against the generated OpenAPI document:

- the generated document is a valid OpenAPI 3.0 document,
- the operations the clients depend on are documented,
- `GET /api/openapi.json` serves exactly the generated spec,
- every documented operation declares at least one `2xx` response,
- representative responses only contain documented fields (a new, accidental
  field fails the test; the few known additive fields are listed explicitly in
  the test), and
- the unknown-route and validation-error envelopes match the documented shape
  and never leak stack traces.

The representative public JSON success responses are checked against the
top-level fields declared in OpenAPI. Admin and ops responses additionally use
`withResponseValidation` at runtime. Public routes are currently contract
tested rather than wrapped with that runtime middleware; this avoids adding a
second response check where a route already owns a typed contract and makes
the documented contract the shared source of truth. When adding a public JSON
route, add a representative success response check and cover its error or
boundary behavior in the route tests. Keep the schema test strict about
unexpected top-level fields; any intentional additive fields must be explained
and listed in `KNOWN_ADDITIVE_FIELDS` in `api-contract.test.ts`.

Single-payload JSON validation intentionally does not apply to `GET /events`,
`GET /events/transactions/:txHash`, or `GET /metrics`: these stream SSE or
Prometheus text over an open connection. Validate event payloads where they
are produced and preserve the documented stream content type and framing.

## HTTP method allowlist

Express dispatches only the verbs registered for a route. An unsupported verb
at an otherwise known resource falls through to the same static 404 contract
as an unknown path. Tests exercise unsupported verbs on write resources and
assert the handler does not run or reflect request data. `HEAD` is supported
as Express's bodyless equivalent of `GET`; `OPTIONS` is handled by the global
CORS middleware as a preflight response and is not a 404. Keep these framework
exceptions explicit when adding or changing method tests.

Run it with:

```bash
npm test -w backend -- api-contract.test.ts
```
