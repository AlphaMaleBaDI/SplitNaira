# Authorization Coverage Tests (issue #1483)

`contracts/authorization_coverage_tests.rs` inventories every public contract
entry point and proves that unauthorized callers fail for each protected
operation. Run it with:

```bash
cargo test --manifest-path contracts/Cargo.toml --features testutils \
    authorization_coverage
```

## Entry-point inventory (34 public functions)

## How "unauthorized callers fail" is asserted

- **Identity-gated operations (11).** The suite drives an impostor address
  through each call and asserts the exact contract error (`Unauthorized`, or
  `AdminNotSet` before an admin is configured), then verifies no state
  changed (pause flag, allowlist, admin, project owner/shares/metadata).
- **Signer-gated operations (4).** `require_auth` is the entire gate; a
  withheld or mismatched authorization is a _host trap_. In this `no_std`
  test build a host trap is a non-unwinding panic (SIGABRT) that kills the
  whole test binary — verified empirically — so the negative direction cannot
  be caught in-process with `try_` calls. Instead the suite asserts the
  positive requirement recorded by the recording auth environment
  (`env.auths()`): each entry point demands an authorization entry for
  exactly the documented signer, and `set_admin` rotation demands the
  _stored_ administrator rather than the address being nominated.
- **Read-only operations (17).** Proven to execute on a fully
  auth-enforcing environment (no `mock_all_auths` at all): if any read path
  secretly called `require_auth`, the test process would abort.

## Related suites

- `authorization_tests.rs` — deep owner/admin boundary tests and the
  permissionless-distribution guarantee (issue #865).
- `failure_invariant_tests.rs` — rejected operations leave storage and
  balances untouched (issue #1486).

## Backend resource routes: persona matrix

`backend/src/routes/collaboration.authz-matrix.test.ts` sends a request from
every persona to every collaboration resource route, through the real router
and middleware chain. Contributors adding a route under `/collaboration` must
add a row here and a matching `ROUTES` entry in that file.

Run it with:

```bash
cd backend && npx vitest run src/routes/collaboration.authz-matrix.test.ts
```

Personas:

- **anonymous:** no `X-Stellar-Address` header.
- **malformed:** a header value that isn't a Stellar address.
- **owner:** the project owner, as recorded in the project's stored collaboration record.
- **admin / editor / viewer:** collaborators with those roles.
- **unrelated:** a valid address with no role on the project.

Roles always come from the stored record, never from the request body.

| Route | anonymous | malformed | owner | admin | editor | viewer | unrelated |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /collaboration/projects/:projectId/delete` | 401 | 400 | **200** | 403 | 403 | 403 | 403 |
| `POST /collaboration/projects/:projectId/invitations` | 401 | 400 | **201** | **201** | 403 | 403 | 403 |
| `POST /collaboration/invitations/:invitationId/cancel`¹ | 401 | 400 | **200** | **200** | 403 | 403 | 403 |
| `POST /collaboration/projects/:projectId/transfer-ownership` | 401 | 400 | **200** | 403 | 403 | 403 | 403 |
| `GET /collaboration/permissions/matrix` (public) | 200 | 200 | 200 | 200 | 200 | 200 | 200 |
| `POST /collaboration/invitations/accept` (token-gated)² | 200 | — | — | — | — | — | — |

¹ In the test, the invitation was sent by the admin. Cancel is allowed for the
inviter or the project owner (`forbidden_not_inviter` otherwise).
² Holding the invitation token is the credential. The caller's identity isn't
checked, by design.

Boundary cases the suite also pins:

- Body fields such as `role`, `owner`, `actor` and `inviterWalletAddress` are
  ignored. A viewer who claims `role: "owner"` still gets a 403.
- No cross-project access. The owner of one project gets 403
  (`project_role_unknown`) on another project.
- It fails closed. An unknown project, or a role authority that throws, gives a
  403 and never a default role.
- A collaborator listed without a role is treated as `viewer`. The owner stays
  `owner` even if also listed with a lower role.
- A header with surrounding whitespace counts as the same identity. A
  lower-cased address is rejected (400) rather than matched.
- After a transfer, the previous owner loses the right to transfer again. A
  denied cancel leaves the invitation `pending`.

This suite adds route-level coverage only. It doesn't change any guard:
`requireStellarAddress`, `createProjectPermissionMiddleware` and the
service-level owner and inviter checks are exercised as they are.
`collaboration.test.ts` (happy paths) and `permissions-enforcement.test.ts`
(middleware unit tests) are unchanged.
